We're going to take our hangman to the next level.

1. When the user wins or loses they should be taken to a new _screen_ that
informs them if they have won or lost.

The user should also be able to click on this screen to start a new game.

2. The game should **java.util.Random**ly pick from one of 3 possible words
  - Dog
  - Cat
  - Jabberwocky
